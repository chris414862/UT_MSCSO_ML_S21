<p><strong>Assignments, Assessment, Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>Homework (40%): There are six homework assignments in this class. Each assignment has two parts: a theory part and a programming part. Homework is due at the time indicated on the assignment and no late homework will be accepted. Homework assignments will be peer-graded and you must complete peer-grading in order to receive a grade for the assignment. Your lowest homework score will be automatically dropped.</p>
<p>Exams (60%): There two exams in this class. Exams are timed and will take no more than two continuous hours. You'll have a 72 hour window in which to complete the two-hour exam. No exam grade will be dropped. No late exams will be accepted. Exams will be graded by the TAs or instructors. </p>
<p>Final grades will be based on +/- letter grade system and will be curved. The following scheme is just a rough guideline:<br />A = 94-100<br />A- = 90-93<br />B+ = 87-89<br />B = 84-86<br />B- = 80-83<br />C+ = 77-79<br />C = 74-76<br />C- = 70-73<br />D+ = 67-69<br />D = 64-66<br />D- = 60-63<br />F = 0-59</p>
<p><em>Program Grade Requirements: </em>30 hour program (9 required hours, 21 elective hour). Required courses, B- or higher. Elective courses, C or higher. To graduate, all students must have a graduate GPA average of at least 3.00.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1em;">Academic Honesty and Collaboration Policy</strong></p>
<p>Collaboration is not allowed on the homeworks. Every homework needs to be solved individually.  We will check for duplicates.   Students may post questions about the homeworks on Piazza and may respond to other students' questions. The online course format allows for multiple methods of identity verification, collusion, collaboration and plagiarism monitoring and detection. A violation of the course policy may include (but is not limited to) the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing your UT EID credentials to any other person</li>
<li>Collaborating or sharing information with another person regarding the material on any assessment or exam.</li>
<li>Recording any exam, assessment or assignment material in any format</li>
<li>Failing to properly cite language, ideas, data, or arguments that are not originally yours</li>
<li>The public (such that it can be viewed by more than one person) posting of any form of a test bank or group of questions from any assignment</li>
<li>Consulting forbidden materials or sources of information</li>
</ul>
<p>The University of Texas at Austin Academic Integrity principles call for students to avoid engaging in any form of academic dishonesty on behalf of yourself or another student. Grade-related penalties are routinely assessed ("F" in the course is not uncommon), but students can also be suspended or even permanently expelled from the University for scholastic dishonesty. If you have any questions about what constitutes academic dishonesty, please refer to the <a href=" http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/" target="[object Object]">Dean of Students website</a> or contact the instructor for this course. By proceeding in this course, you agree to abide by the Honor Code of the University of Texas. You will not work with or collaborate with others in any way while completing any of the graded course assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Documented Disability Statement</strong></p>
<p>Any student with a documented disability who requires academic accommodations should contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at (512) 471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (videophone).  Faculty are not required to provide accommodations without an official accommodation letter from SSD. Please notify me as quickly as possible if the material being presented in class is  not  accessible  (e.g.,  instructional  videos  need  captioning,  course  packets  are  not  readable  for proper alternative text conversion,  etc.).  Contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone) or reference SSDs website for more disability-related information: <a href="https://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/" target="[object Object]">https://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Behavior Concerns Advice Line</strong></p>
<p>If you are worried about someone who is acting differently,  you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss by phone your concerns about another individuals behavior.  This service is provided through a partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling andMental Health Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit <a href="https://besafe.utexas.edu/behavior-concerns-advice-line" target="[object Object]">https://besafe.utexas.edu/behavior-concerns-advice-line</a></p>
<p><strong>Academic Advisor Support</strong></p>
<p>If you have additional questions or require support from an academic advisor, please contact the program coordinator at <a href="mailto:msonline@cs.utexas.edu" target="[object Object]">MCSOGradCoordinator@austin.utexas.edu</a>.
